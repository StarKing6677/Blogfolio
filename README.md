# [CREATIVE WORKS](https://github.com/crislin2046/portfolio/blob/master/README.md#creative-works)

In software I've made open-source creative works in 4 main areas: [cryptography](#cryptography), [web development](#web-development), [browsing technology](#browsing-technology) and [utilities](#utilities). 

## Stats

In total my open-source projects have:

- been used by **more than 15,000 people**
- garnered more than **2,500 stars** on GitHub, and 
- been downloaded more than **25,000 times** across DockerHub, NPM and GitHub releases.

## Bona Fides

Besides the projects below which are all my own work, here are some other links:

## [Browsing Technology](https://github.com/crislin2046/portfolio/blob/master/README.md#browsing-technology)

My browsing technology works (also known as browser controllers) center around enhancements to the way you normally might browse.

### [:classical_building: 22120](https://github.com/dosyago/22120) 

#### [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/archivist1.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/dosyago/22120/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/archivist1) ![binary downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/dosyago/22120/total?label=binary%20downloads) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dosyago/22120.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://GitHub.com/dosyago/22120/stargazers/)

**22120** (named for the Vatican library) is a browser controller that lets you self host an offline archive of the internet. The part of it you browsed, at least. Your browser never knows the difference.

### [:satellite: BrowserGap](https://github.com/dosyago/BrowserGap) 

#### [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/remoteview.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/dosyago/RemoteView/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/remoteview) ![docker pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/dosyago/browsergapce) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dosyago/RemoteView.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://GitHub.com/dosyago/RemoteView/stargazers/)

**BrowserGap** lets you live-stream the browser interactively. You can run it headless, or not. Local, or remote. You can build on top of it. But what it really is is an example of the platform to be able to build on top of the browser in ways you couldn't previously.

### [:mag:	Selector-Generalization](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selector-generalization)

#### [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/selector-generalization.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/crislin2046/selector-generalization/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/selector-generalization)

**Selector-Generalization** is novel algorithm for data collection exposed as a package of JavaScript utils to generalize a set of CSS selectors to a single selector that matches them all. Useful for picking columns of data from a view and for mapping the structure of web apps to use as data sources or for automation.

## [Web Development](https://github.com/crislin2046/portfolio/blob/master/README.md#web-development)

My web development works center around "frameworks" to make coding the web easier. 

### [:dog2: Bepis](https://github.com/dosyago/bepis) 

#### [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/bepis.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/dosyago/bepis/releases/latest) ![npm downloads total](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/bepis) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dosyago/bepis.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://GitHub.com/dosyago/bepis/stargazers/)

**Bepis** (named en homage to the [meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbqdh5duDuU)) is a silly but useful way to write markup in a kindof-sortof *shorthand* for HTML. It just makes quickly parsing and writing markup easier (when you're not trying to count your pesky **.** characters, at least). Drincc up!

### [:bug: Dumbass](https://github.com/dosyago/dumbass)

#### [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dumbass.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/dosyago/dumbass/releases/latest) ![npm downloads total](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/dumbass) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dosyago/dumbass.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://GitHub.com/dosyago/dumbass/stargazers/)

**Dumbass** is a tool for stupid people. Aren't we all? Use it when you don't want to think hard about building UIs, and care not for opinions. 

## [Cryptography](https://github.com/crislin2046/portfolio/blob/master/README.md#cryptography)

My cryptography works are centered around novel primitives and simple, magic-free designs, written in portable, readable code that isn't super-optimized in order to preserve legibility (*and because I don't know too much about architecture based super optimization* :man_shrugging:).

### [:baby_chick: Floppsy](https://github.com/dosyago/floppsy)

#### **[200MB/s, passes all SMHasher](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/blob/master/doc/floppsyhash.txt)** [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/floppsy.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/dosyago/floppsy/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/floppsy)

**Floppsy** is a hashing algorithm that passes SMHasher, meaning it stands alongside the best algorithms known. It's slower than most, clocking a modest 200Mb/s on an average workstation. Interstingly, I created it inspired by Egyptian fractions and continued fractions. It uses all floating point arithmetic, a hash-function first.

### [:dancers: Discohash](https://github.com/cris691/discohash)

#### **[2 - 5 GB/s, passes all SMHasher](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/blob/master/doc/BEBB4185.txt)**  [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/bebb4185.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/cris691/discohash/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/bebb4185) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/cris691/discohash.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://GitHub.com/cris691/discohash/stargazers/)

**Discohash** (*also known as* **BEBB4185**) is a super-fast non-cryptographic hash that passes SMHasher, and runs at 2 - 5GB/s (depending on hardware) in this naive, portable implementation.

### [:gem: Beamsplitter](https://github.com/cris691/beamsplitter)

#### **[500 - 800MB/s, passes all SMHasher](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher/blob/master/doc/beamsplitter.txt)** [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/beamsplitter.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/cris691/beamsplitter/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/beamsplitter) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/cris691/beamsplitter.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://GitHub.com/cris691/beamsplitter/stargazers/)

**Beamsplitter** (named for the [optical device](https://www.edmundoptics.com.tw/c/laser-optics/754/?#Categories=Categories%3ANzYy0)) is a SMHasher-passing family of hash functions parameterized over the choice of a high-entropy random 10x64 S-box. It's not particularly fast, and at 500 - 800MB/s (depending on hardware) is faster than SHA1, SHA2 and SHA3.

### [:alien: Xen](https://github.com/dosyago/xen) 

#### [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/xen.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/dosyago/xen/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/xen) 

**Xen** is a set of crypto tools made from mostly unknown primitives I invented. Its output passes Practrand and Dieharder, meaning it is statistically indistinguishable from randomness.

### [:bento: Tarobox](https://github.com/dosyago/tarobox) 

#### [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/tarobox.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/dosyago/tarobox/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/tarobox) 

**Tarobox** (anagram of xor and `btoa`) is named based on its constituent parts. It's a Diehard-passing pseudo-random number generator built out of the simple, reusable components of: a base64 expansion function, and a wrap-and-xor compression function. It's simple, but performs really well statistically. It's not fast, however.

## [Utilities](https://github.com/crislin2046/portfolio/blob/master/README.md#utilities)

Collected, assorted, high-utility miscellania. 

### [:balance_scale: jtype-system](https://github.com/crislin2046/jtype-system) 

#### ![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/jtype-system?label=%22%22) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/jtype-system)

Simple type-checking system for JavaScript at runtime.

### [:page_facing_up: p2.](https://github.com/dosyago/p2.) 

#### [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dosyago/p2..svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://GitHub.com/dosyago/p2./stargazers/)

**p2.** is a simple PDF to PNG server that also works for XSLX, DOCX, and other documents.

### [:card_file_box: stubdb](https://github.com/crislin2046/stubdb) 

#### [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/stubdb.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/cris691/stubdb/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/stubdb) 

**stubdb** is very simple "database" on the file system for when you're too small to fail.

### [:keycap_ten: Abacus](https://github.com/crislin2046/bitmath) 

#### [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/bitmath.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/crislin2046/abacus/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/bitmath) 

**Abacus** is bit arithmetic package to add, subtract, multiply, euclidean divide bit arrays of any size.

### [:wind_chime: Uint1Array](https://github.com/crislin2046/Uint1Array) 

#### [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/uint1array.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/crislin2046/Uint1Array/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/uint1array) 

**Uint1Array** is JavaScript's missing TypedArray. Bit-level view of any underlying ArrayBuffer.

### [:small_airplane: environments](https://github.com/cris691/environments)

#### [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/environments.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/cris691/environments/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/environments) 

My coding **environments** (some dotfiles, and configs) and useful tools.
