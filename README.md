# portfolio 

the vast and unfathomable expanse of my brilliant creative work

In software I've made works in 4 main areas: cryptography, web development, browsing technology and utilities.

# Cryptography Works

My cryptography works are centered around novel primitives and simple, zero magic designs.

## :alien: [xen](https://github.com/dosyago/xen) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/xen) ![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/xen)

**Xen** is a set of crypto tools made from mostly unknown primitives I invented. Its output passes Practrand and Dieharder, meaning it is statistically indistinguishable from randomness.

## :baby_chick: [floppsy](https://github.com/dosyago/floppsy) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/floppsy) ![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/floppsy)

**Floppsy** is a hashing algorithm that passes SMHasher, meaning it stands alongside the best algorithms known. It's slower than most, clocking a modest 200Mb/s on an average workstation. Interstingly, I created it inspired by Egyptian fractions and continued fractions. It uses all floating point arithmetic, a hash-function first.

## :stars: [beamsplitter](https://github.com/dosyago/beamsplitter) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/beamsplitter) ![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/beamsplitter)

**Beamsplitter** (from the laser guide) is a hash I built based entirely on s-boxes. That's a substituition box, a fast, old school cryptography primitive. This hash does not pass SMHasher. I'm currently working to improve its quality and speed.

## :bento: [tarobox](https://github.com/dosyago/tarobox) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/tarobox) ![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/tarobox) 

**Tarobox** (anagram of xor and `btoa`) is named based on its constituent parts. It's a Diehard-passing pseudo-random number generator built out of the simple, reusable components of: a base64 expansion function, and a wrap-and-xor compression function. It's simple, but performs really well statistically. It's not fast, however.

# Web Development Works

My web development works center around "frameworks" to make coding the web easier. I try to built thigns I will want to work with, and use, that make me more productive, while riffing off being inspired by current trends and developments, taking the best of other works and discarding all the cruft. I like to build simple tools.

## :dog2: [bepis](#drincc) ![download badge](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/bepis) ![version badge](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/bepis/latest)

**Bepis** (named en homage to the [meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbqdh5duDuU)] is a silly but useful way to write HTML in a kindof, sortof *shorthand* for actual HTML. It just makes quickly parsing and writing markup easier (when you're not trying to count your pesky **.** characters, at least). Drincc up!

## :bug: [dumbass](https://github.com/dosyago/dumbass) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dumbass.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/dosyago/dumbass/releases/latest) ![npm downloads total](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/dumbass)

**dumbass** (what a lovely, evocative name) is my beautiful project to make building UIs **simple**. So simple you can do it half-drunk, at 3 am, with burnout and a post-feat hangover. *Love not having to think to make UI. Love **dumbass***!
