# [CREATIVE WORKS](https://github.com/crislin2046/portfolio/blob/master/README.md#creative-works)

In software I've made works in 4 main areas: [cryptography](#cryptography), [web development](#web-development), [browsing technology](#browsing-technology) and [utilities](#utilities). 

**Stats**

In total my projects have been used by thousands of people, garnered more than 1,750 stars on GitHub, and been downloaded more than 8,000 times from DockerHub, NPM and GitHub releases.

## [Browsing Technology](https://github.com/crislin2046/portfolio/blob/master/README.md#browsing-technology)

My browsing technology works (also known as browser controllers) center around enhancements to the way you normally might browse.

### :classical_building: [22120](https://github.com/dosyago/22120) [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/archivist1.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/dosyago/22120/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/archivist1) 

![binary downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/dosyago/22120/total?label=binary%20downloads)  [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dosyago/22120.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://GitHub.com/dosyago/22120/stargazers/)

**22120** (named for the Vatican library) is a browser controller that lets you self host an offline archive of the internet. Well everything you browse anyway. your browser never knows the difference. this was very easy to build. I'm very happy about this one.

### :satellite: [RemoteView](https://github.com/dosyago/RemoteView) [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/remoteview.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/dosyago/RemoteView/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/remoteview) ![docker pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/dosyago/browsergapce) 

[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dosyago/RemoteView.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://GitHub.com/dosyago/RemoteView/stargazers/)

**RemoteView** lets you live-stream the browser interactively. You can run it headless, or not. Local, or remote. You can build on top of it. But what it really is is an example of the platform to be able to build on top of the browser. In ways you couldn't previously.

### :umbrella: [Selector-Generalization](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selector-generalization) [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/selector-generalization.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/crislin2046/selector-generalization/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/selector-generalization)

**Selector-Generalization** is a package of JavaScript utils to generalize a set of CSS selectors to a single selector that matches them all. Useful for picking columns of data from a view and for mapping the structure of web apps to use as data sources or for automation.

## [Web Development](https://github.com/crislin2046/portfolio/blob/master/README.md#web-development)

My web development works center around "frameworks" to make coding the web easier. 

### :dog2: [Bepis](https://github.com/dosyago/bepis) [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/bepis.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/dosyago/bepis/releases/latest) ![npm downloads total](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/bepis) 

[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dosyago/bepis.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://GitHub.com/dosyago/bepis/stargazers/)

**Bepis** (named en homage to the [meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbqdh5duDuU)] is a silly but useful way to write HTML in a kindof, sortof *shorthand* for actual HTML. It just makes quickly parsing and writing markup easier (when you're not trying to count your pesky **.** characters, at least). Drincc up!

### :bug: [Dumbass](https://github.com/dosyago/dumbass)  [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dumbass.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/dosyago/dumbass/releases/latest) ![npm downloads total](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/dumbass) 

[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dosyago/dumbass.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://GitHub.com/dosyago/dumbass/stargazers/)

**Dumbass** (what a lovely, evocative name) is my beautiful project to make building UIs **simple**. So simple you can do it half-drunk, at 3 am, with burnout and a post-feat hangover. *Love not having to think to make UI. Love **dumbass***!

## [Cryptography](https://github.com/crislin2046/portfolio/blob/master/README.md#cryptography)

My cryptography works are centered around novel primitives and simple, magic-free designs.

### :alien: [Xen](https://github.com/dosyago/xen) [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/xen.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/dosyago/xen/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/xen) 

**Xen** is a set of crypto tools made from mostly unknown primitives I invented. Its output passes Practrand and Dieharder, meaning it is statistically indistinguishable from randomness.

### :baby_chick: [Floppsy](https://github.com/dosyago/floppsy) [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/floppsy.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/dosyago/floppsy/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/floppsy) 

**Floppsy** is a hashing algorithm that passes SMHasher, meaning it stands alongside the best algorithms known. It's slower than most, clocking a modest 200Mb/s on an average workstation. Interstingly, I created it inspired by Egyptian fractions and continued fractions. It uses all floating point arithmetic, a hash-function first.

### :stars: [Beamsplitter](https://github.com/dosyago/beamsplitter) [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/beamsplitter.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/dosyago/beamsplitter/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/beamsplitter) 

**Beamsplitter** (from the laser guide) is a hash I built based entirely on s-boxes. That's a substituition box, a fast, old school cryptography primitive. This hash does not pass SMHasher. I'm currently working to improve its quality and speed.

### :bento: [Tarobox](https://github.com/dosyago/tarobox) [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/tarobox.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/dosyago/tarobox/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/tarobox) 

**Tarobox** (anagram of xor and `btoa`) is named based on its constituent parts. It's a Diehard-passing pseudo-random number generator built out of the simple, reusable components of: a base64 expansion function, and a wrap-and-xor compression function. It's simple, but performs really well statistically. It's not fast, however.

## [Utilities](https://github.com/crislin2046/portfolio/blob/master/README.md#utilities)

Collected, assorted, high-utility miscellania. 

### :page_facing_up: [p2.](https://github.com/dosyago/p2.) 

[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dosyago/p2..svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://GitHub.com/dosyago/p2./stargazers/)

**p2.** is a simple PDF to PNG server that also works for XSLX, DOCX, and other documents.

### :card_file_box: [stubdb](https://github.com/crislin2046/stubdb) [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/stubdb.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/crislin2046/stubdb/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/stubdb) 

**stubdb** is very simple "database" on the file system for when you're too small to fail.

### :keycap_ten: [Abacus](https://github.com/crislin2046/bitmath) [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/bitmath.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/crislin2046/abacus/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/bitmath) 

**Abacus** is bit arithmetic package to add, subtract, multiply, euclidean divide bit arrays of any size.

### :wind_chime: [Uint1Array](https://github.com/crislin2046/Uint1Array) [![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/uint1array.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/crislin2046/Uint1Array/releases/latest) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/uint1array) 

**Uint1Array** is JavaScript's missing TypedArray. Bit-level view of any underlying ArrayBuffer.
