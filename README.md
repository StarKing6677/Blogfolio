# CREATIVE WORKS

The vast, unmitiaged and unfathomable expanse of my brilliant creative work.

In software I've made works in 4 main areas: cryptography, web development, browsing technology and utilities.

## Cryptography

My cryptography works are centered around novel primitives and simple, zero magic designs.

### :alien: [xen](https://github.com/dosyago/xen) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/xen) ![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/xen) 

**Xen** is a set of crypto tools made from mostly unknown primitives I invented. Its output passes Practrand and Dieharder, meaning it is statistically indistinguishable from randomness.

### :baby_chick: [floppsy](https://github.com/dosyago/floppsy) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/floppsy) ![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/floppsy)

**Floppsy** is a hashing algorithm that passes SMHasher, meaning it stands alongside the best algorithms known. It's slower than most, clocking a modest 200Mb/s on an average workstation. Interstingly, I created it inspired by Egyptian fractions and continued fractions. It uses all floating point arithmetic, a hash-function first.

### :stars: [beamsplitter](https://github.com/dosyago/beamsplitter) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/beamsplitter) ![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/beamsplitter)

**Beamsplitter** (from the laser guide) is a hash I built based entirely on s-boxes. That's a substituition box, a fast, old school cryptography primitive. This hash does not pass SMHasher. I'm currently working to improve its quality and speed.

### :bento: [tarobox](https://github.com/dosyago/tarobox) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/tarobox) ![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/tarobox) 

**Tarobox** (anagram of xor and `btoa`) is named based on its constituent parts. It's a Diehard-passing pseudo-random number generator built out of the simple, reusable components of: a base64 expansion function, and a wrap-and-xor compression function. It's simple, but performs really well statistically. It's not fast, however.

## Web Development

My web development works center around "frameworks" to make coding the web easier. I try to built thigns I will want to work with, and use, that make me more productive, while riffing off being inspired by current trends and developments, taking the best of other works and discarding all the cruft. I like to build simple tools.

### :dog2: [bepis](#drincc) ![download badge](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/bepis) ![version badge](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/bepis/latest) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dosyago/bepis.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://GitHub.com/dosyago/bepis/stargazers/)

**Bepis** (named en homage to the [meme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbqdh5duDuU)] is a silly but useful way to write HTML in a kindof, sortof *shorthand* for actual HTML. It just makes quickly parsing and writing markup easier (when you're not trying to count your pesky **.** characters, at least). Drincc up!

### :bug: [dumbass](https://github.com/dosyago/dumbass) ![npm downloads total](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/dumbass)  [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dumbass.svg?label=&color=0080FF)](https://github.com/dosyago/dumbass/releases/latest) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dosyago/dumbass.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://GitHub.com/dosyago/dumbass/stargazers/)

**dumbass** (what a lovely, evocative name) is my beautiful project to make building UIs **simple**. So simple you can do it half-drunk, at 3 am, with burnout and a post-feat hangover. *Love not having to think to make UI. Love **dumbass***!

## Browsing Technology

My browsing technology (also known as browser controllers) works center around the design, implementation and improvement of game-changing enhancements to the way you normally might browse **human kinds vast array of all knowledge ever**. Yep, I'm a bit of a **web idealist** but I really believe in what I do here. I think these are my most likely paths to future success, and I **love** to work on them.

## :classical_building: [22120](https://github.com/dosyago/22120) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/archivist1?label=npm%20downloads) ![binary downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/dosyago/22120/total?label=binary%20downloads) [![latest package](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/dosyago/22120?label=latest%20release)](https://github.com/dosyago/22120/releases) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dosyago/22120.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://GitHub.com/dosyago/22120/stargazers/)

22120 (named for...*well that's a secret now, y'all...*) **LITERALLY MAKES THE INTERNET OFFLINE AVAILABALLZ**. Seriously, you can now **SELF HOST THE WHOLE INTERNETZ**. Well, that parts of it which you had the benefit (privilege? trouble?) to browse in any case. I love how easy this is, and was to do, and how it became, **MY MOST POPULAR PROJECT EVAAAHHH**. RAAA. I'm very happy about this one.

## :satellite: [RemoteView](https://github.com/dosyago/RemoteView) ![docker pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/dosyago/browsergapce) ![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/remoteview) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/remoteview)  [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dosyago/RemoteView.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://GitHub.com/dosyago/RemoteView/stargazers/)

**RemoteView** lets you live-stream the browser interactively. You can run it headless, or not. Local, or remote. You can build on top of it. But what it really is, is the foundation of my future financial success. You bettabelieveit. Ooh yeah. OOo rah!.

## Utilities

Collected, assorted, miscellania, but high-utility y'all.

### :page_facing_up: [p2.](https://github.com/dosyago/p2.) [![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dosyago/p2..svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://GitHub.com/dosyago/p2./stargazers/)

Just a simple PDF to PNG server (with an awesome name, if I say so myself. I do, did you hear me? **I DO**). Okay, so well now here it is, coming right up the big description you've all been waiting for&hellip; and it's nothing. Yep, it really is **just this**. Just **what is**. Just **what is what** :joycat:. Okay now but it works for PDF, also XSLX, DOCX, etc.

### :card_file_box: [stubdb](https://github.com/crislin2046/stubdb) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/stubdb) ![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/stubdb?label=version)

A very simple "database" on the file system for when you're too small to fail.

### :keycap_ten: [abacus](https://github.com/crislin2046/bitmath) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/bitmath) ![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/bitmath)

bit arithmetic package to add, subtract, multiply, euclidean divide bit arrays of any size.

### :wind_chime: [Uint1Array](https://github.com/crislin2046/Uint1Array) ![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dt/uint1array) ![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/uint1array)
